# Neovim config from scratch

This is obtained from following along with the Primagean's video at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE,which led to the configuration at
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua.


Note that if you want to debug anything related to packages, the data directory
when using `NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-primagean` will by default be
`~.local/share/nvim-primagean/lazy/lazy.nvim`
